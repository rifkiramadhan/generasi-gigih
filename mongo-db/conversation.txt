The Topic Is: Solving a computer problem (because the performance slows down)

Partner 1 (Adam): My computer has been running really slow lately. What do you think I should do?


Partner 2 (Dany): There could be many reasons for this issue, Adam. It might be due to low storage space, 
too many running applications, or even a virus.


Adam: What do you mean by "too many running applications"?


Dany: To clarify, your computer might slow down if you have too many programs or applications 
open at the same time, because they use your computer's memory and processing power.


Adam: So I should close some applications?


Dany: In other words, yes, try to keep only the applications that you're actively using open. 
Also, ensure that there aren't any unnecessary programs running in the background.


Adam: I see, and how about the low storage space?


Dany: Let me explain that in more detail. If your hard drive is almost full, 
it can cause your computer to slow down. You might need to delete some unnecessary 
files or move them to external storage.


Adam: Got it. And what should I do if it's a virus?


Dany: To put it simply, you should run an antivirus scan. If the scan finds any threats, 
the software will quarantine or remove them.


Adam: Thank you for your advice. Iâ€™ll do it.
